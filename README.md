# Masquerade
A discord Bot to hide yourself because you don't assume your own identity

By the way no need to warn you, you can probably use this bot for illegal activities...
Don't do it,I'm not responsibl forany of your actions

Feel free to improve it, tweak it and make a pinball game out of it.

Utilisation
"node main.js master target [victim]"

master is you: give your username
target is the person with which you want to communicate
victim is the identity you use

the bot must know everyone of those three persons (it must be in the same server than everyone)

You cant change your identity more than 2 times an hour (discord limitation)
